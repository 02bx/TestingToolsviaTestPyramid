* Hibernate - Hibernate ORM enables developers to more easily write applications whose data outlives the application process. 
As an Object/Relational Mapping (ORM) framework, Hibernate is concerned with data persistence as it applies to relational databases 
(via JDBC). http://hibernate.org/orm/what-is-an-orm/

* morphia - MongoDB object-document mapper in Java based on https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-java-driver https://github.com/mongodb/morphia

* MyBatis - MyBatis is a first class persistence framework with support for custom SQL, stored procedures and advanced mappings. 
MyBatis eliminates almost all of the JDBC code and manual setting of parameters and retrieval of results. MyBatis can use simple 
XML or Annotations for configuration and map primitives, Map interfaces and Java POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) to database records.
