### Monitoring and automation
* Hive CI - is a CI Platform for on-device testing. It encompasses a number of applications, tools and libraries that we use at the BBC for testing our applications and websites on devices.
Hive Scheduler - This is the hive web application for scheduling tests and viewing results
Hive Runner - This is the component that detects devices and runs the tests. You can install runners on multiple machines and they will all run tests from the scheduler and report results back in.
Hive Mind - This is the device database. Though not essential for the running of Hive CI it enables better monitoring and control of devices.
