### C# 
* NUnit - NUnit features a fluent assert syntax, parameterized, generic and theory tests and is user-extensible.
This package includes the NUnit 3 framework assembly, which is referenced by your tests. You will need to install version 3 of the nunit3-console program or a third-party runner that supports NUnit 3 in order to execute tests. Runners intended for use with NUnit 2.x will not run NUnit 3 tests correctly.

* MSTest (Visual Studio Test) - This is MSTest V2, the evolution of Microsoft's Test Framework.
To discover and execute tests install MSTest.TestAdapter. 
To discover and execute tests for project.json based projects install dotnet-test-mstest.
