### C# 
* NUnit - NUnit features a fluent assert syntax, parameterized, generic and theory tests and is user-extensible.
This package includes the NUnit 3 framework assembly, which is referenced by your tests. You will need to install version 3 of the nunit3-console program or a third-party runner that supports NUnit 3 in order to execute tests. Runners intended for use with NUnit 2.x will not run NUnit 3 tests correctly.

* MSTest (Visual Studio Test) - This is MSTest V2, the evolution of Microsoft's Test Framework.
To discover and execute tests install MSTest.TestAdapter. 
To discover and execute tests for project.json based projects install dotnet-test-mstest.

* xUnit.net - is a free, open source, community-focused unit testing tool for the .NET Framework. Written by the original inventor of NUnit v2, xUnit.net is the latest technology for unit testing C#, F#, VB.NET and other .NET languages. xUnit.net works with ReSharper, CodeRush, TestDriven.NET and Xamarin.

* mb-unit - The Gallio Automation Platform is an open, extensible, and neutral system for .NET that provides a common object model, runtime services and tools (such as test runners) that may be leveraged by any number of test frameworks.
MbUnit is an extensible unit testing framework for the .NET Framework that takes in and goes beyond xUnit pattern testing. MbUnit is part of the Gallio bundle.
