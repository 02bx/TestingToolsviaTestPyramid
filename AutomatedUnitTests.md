### C# 
* NUnit - NUnit features a fluent assert syntax, parameterized, generic and theory tests and is user-extensible.
This package includes the NUnit 3 framework assembly, which is referenced by your tests. You will need to install version 3 of the nunit3-console program or a third-party runner that supports NUnit 3 in order to execute tests. Runners intended for use with NUnit 2.x will not run NUnit 3 tests correctly.

* MSTest (Visual Studio Test) - This is MSTest V2, the evolution of Microsoft's Test Framework.
To discover and execute tests install MSTest.TestAdapter. 
To discover and execute tests for project.json based projects install dotnet-test-mstest.

* xUnit.net - is a free, open source, community-focused unit testing tool for the .NET Framework. Written by the original inventor of NUnit v2, xUnit.net is the latest technology for unit testing C#, F#, VB.NET and other .NET languages. xUnit.net works with ReSharper, CodeRush, TestDriven.NET and Xamarin.

* mb-unit - The Gallio Automation Platform is an open, extensible, and neutral system for .NET that provides a common object model, runtime services and tools (such as test runners) that may be leveraged by any number of test frameworks.
MbUnit is an extensible unit testing framework for the .NET Framework that takes in and goes beyond xUnit pattern testing. MbUnit is part of the Gallio bundle.

* Ncover - Code Coverage tool

* OpenCover - A code coverage tool for .NET 2 and above (WINDOWS OS only), support for 32 and 64 processes with both branch and sequence points 

* XMLUnit - Unit Testing XML for Java and .NET http://www.xmlunit.org/

### Java 
* XMLUnit - Unit Testing XML for Java and .NET http://www.xmlunit.org/

* Junit - The new major version of the programmer-friendly testing framework for Java 8 JUnit 5 is the next generation of JUnit. The goal is to create an up-to-date foundation for developer-side testing on the JVM. This includes focusing on Java 8 and above, as well as enabling many different styles of testing.http://junit.org/junit5/

* TestNG - TestNG is a testing framework inspired from JUnit and NUnit but introducing some new functionalities that make it more powerful and easier to use http://testng.org/doc/ 

* test-data-supplier - Extended TestNG DataProvider https://github.com/sskorol/test-data-supplier

### JavaScript 
* Mocha - Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun. Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases. Hosted on GitHub. http://mochajs.org/

* Chai - Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework. http://chaijs.com/

* Wallaby.js -  runs your JavaScript tests immediately as you type and displays execution results in your code editor. It also provides beautiful test and code coverage reports updated in realtime. https://wallabyjs.com/

### Python 
* unittest - The unittest unit testing framework was originally inspired by JUnit and has a similar flavor as major unit testing frameworks in other languages. It supports test automation, sharing of setup and shutdown code for tests, aggregation of tests into collections, and independence of the tests from the reporting framework. htps://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html

* unittest2 - unittest2 is a backport of the new features added to the unittest testing framework in Python 2.7 and onwards. It is tested to run on Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and pypy. https://pypi.python.org/pypi/unittest2

* pytest - The pytest framework makes it easy to write small tests, yet scales to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries. https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/
http://plugincompat.herokuapp.com/

* nose - nose extends unittest to make testing easier.https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

* slash - Slash is a testing framework written in Python, intended for testing large scale projects, especially in integration scenarios. Slash focuses on customization and extensibility, allow you to tailor the framework for your specific needs, making it your testing framework. https://github.com/getslash/slash

* Proboscis - Proboscis is a Python test framework that extends Python’s built-in unittest module and Nose with features from TestNG. https://pythonhosted.org/proboscis/

* Trial - Trial is Twisted's unit testing system, an extension of ​Python's `unittest` module.
Trial is two things. The first is a command-line test runner, which can be run on plain Python unit tests. It's very simple to use http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedTrial

* subunit - Subunit is a streaming protocol for test results. The protocol is a binary encoding that is easily generated and parsed. By design all the components of the protocol conceptually fit into the xUnit TestCase->TestResult interaction. https://launchpad.net/subunit

* Pythoscope - Pythoscope is a unit test generator for programs written in Python. http://pythoscope.org/

* dutest - An object-oriented API to test doctests using unittest runners. https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dutest

* assertpy Dead simple assertion library for unit testing in python with a fluent API  https://github.com/ActivisionGameScience/assertpy

### Ruby 
* Test::Unit Test::Unit is an implementation of the xUnit testing framework for Ruby.
If you are writing new test code, please use MiniTest instead of Test::Unit.
Test::Unit has been left in the standard library to support legacy test suites. http://ruby-doc.org//stdlib-2.1.5//libdoc/test/unit/rdoc/Test/Unit.html
